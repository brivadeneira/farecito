"""
Implements tests for Neo4j-based data models.

This module contains test cases for the data models used in the Neo4j graph database.
The data models tested include Price, Location, Node, BusStationNode, NodeRelationShip,
UnstructuredGraph, and Neo4JConn.

Each test case checks the validity of the attributes and properties of the respective model.
The tests include validation of data types, cypher representation, and specific constraints.

Note: The test cases use pytest and the Pydantic library for data validation.

Tested Models:
- Price: Represents the price data model.
- Location: Represents the geographic location data model.
- Node: Represents a generic data model for nodes in the graph database.
- BusStationNode: Represents a data model for bus station nodes.
- NodeRelationShip: Represents a data model for relationships between nodes.
- UnstructuredGraph: Represents a data model for unstructured graphs.
- Neo4JConn: Represents a data model for connecting to the Neo4j database.
